SWISH LOGO SETUP
================

To display the Swish logo properly:

1. Download the official Swish logo (PNG format)
2. Name it: swish-logo.png
3. Place it in this directory: /assets/images/

If you don't have the logo file:
- The buttons will still work, just without the logo image
- Download from: https://www.swish.nu/brand
- Or use your existing image from wp-content/uploads

The code will automatically use: 
- /assets/images/swish-logo.png (bundled with plugin)
- Falls back gracefully if image doesn't exist
